# Customer Grouping with K-Means Clustering

## Overview

This project utilizes K-Means clustering to segment customers into groups based on their spending score, age, and annual income. The goal is to gain insights into customer behavior for targeted marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is [kaggle Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python), which contains customer information, including spending score, age, and annual income. You can access the dataset [provide a link if publicly available].

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install Required Library


## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook file `Kmeans.ipynb` to perform K-Means clustering on the dataset.

2. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in the notebook to explore, preprocess, and cluster the data.

3. Customize the clustering parameters and visualization options as needed.

4. Analyze the results, including customer group profiles, and use these insights for marketing strategies.

## Results

The K-Means clustering resulted in 2 customer groups. Each group is characterized by specific spending behaviors, age ranges, and income levels. You can find detailed results and visualizations in the Notebook.
